# Jenkins Property Files

The Repositories (AccountsCMDB, ProductCMDB, and Code ) are linked together in the application lifecyle management service (ALM).
The Gen3 framework establishes the environmental configuration based on the location of the process calling the framework, when running as a Jenkins job the location is determined using 2 methods, the location of the Job in the job folder structure and properties files which, combined with the EnvInjector plugin which inserts environment variables into the run time of the job.

## Properties Files

The properties files follow a heirachy structure, with a server level properties folder and a properties file per product.
These are stored in

```text
/opt/var/codeontap
