# Local Codeontap Tasks

Most of the time codeontap commands are executed from the automation service. But there are some cases where you need to run codeontap locally, such as the setup of the automation service or managing the encryption sensitive settings.

## Prerequisites

- Docker
- AWS Secret and Access Key configured as a cli profile [AWS Named Profiles](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-multiple-profiles.html)
